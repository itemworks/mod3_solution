        <p>The towels had been hanging from the rod for years. They were stained and worn, and quite frankly, just plain ugly.
        Debra didn't want to touch them but she really didn't have a choice. 
        It was important for her to see what was living within them. Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She couldn't take her eyes off the water swirling around and around. 
        She stuck in small twigs and leaves to watch the whirlpool catch them and then suck them down. 
        It bothered her more than a little bit that this could also be used as a metaphor for her life.</p>

        <p>What were they eating? It didn't taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished, she didn't dare ask. 
            She knew the answer would be one she didn't want to hear.It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality, it was an unbelievably terrible idea, 
            but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this very moment</p>

        <p>The alarm went off at exactly 6:00 AM as it had every morning for the past five years. Barbara began her morning and was ready to eat breakfast by 7:00 AM. The day appeared to be as normal as any other, but that was about to change. 
        In fact, it was going to change at exactly 7:23 AM. It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. 
        Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.</p>
